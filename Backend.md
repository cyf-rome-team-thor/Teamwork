# Backend Development

By backend development we usually refer to programming applications that run on a server, usually for providing api to a frontend or for executing a batch scheduled process (example: nigthly database backup, scheduled email send, etc). 
Such programs are often referred as services (or microservoces or webservices).

A backend developer can work in many languages: Javascript (nodejs), Java, Python, Php, C# just to name the most popular. The choice of the language usually depends on what's already on the server as well as on what the development team is used to. Some command line ability is required, too.

Also, backend developers collaborate closely with other professionals such as system administrators, database administrators, architects, but it's not uncommon for them to do everything by themself.

Specifically for a web application backend, a common functionality is all about:
* ⬇️ taking input from the network (example: incoming HTTP request from the frontend)
* ⬇️ elaborate input (example: validate the correctness)
* ⬇️ read and/or write to the database
* ⬇️ formatting output
* ⬇️ emitting output to the network (example: as an HTTP response to the frontend)

Common activities for a Backend Developer include:
* to design api interface
* to implement and mantain the application business logic
* do shape the data structure to be persisted on database
* to ensure data consistency by validating data coming as input
