# System Administration

The System Administrator (or Sysadmin) is the person in charge of maintaining all the backend and frontend applications up and running.

Common activities for a Sysadmin include:
* setup server machines by installing/updating all the libraries needed by the application (ex: nodejs runtime)
* setup network connections (example: open/close ports, define hostname)
* mantain such machines in correct shape (example: cleaning up logs, watch performance metrics)
* setup domain dns
* size-up hardware requirements based on the application load
